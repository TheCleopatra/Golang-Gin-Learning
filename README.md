# Golang-Gin-Learning

This is a golang-learning repo, following the turorial of this [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR0WnWL2o1Q&list=PL3eAkoh7fypr8zrkiygiY1e9osoqjoV9w)

Each [ checkpoint ] will be shown in the commit comments when I finish one course. You can try `git lg` and `git reset` to check code in different stages.
